            3. List main themes or topics discussed.
            4. Assess the overall sentiment of the meeting as one of: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

            Please format your response like this:

            **Summary:**
            <Your summary here>

            **Action Items:**
            - <Action item 1>
            - <Action item 2>

            **Main Themes:**
            - <Theme 1>
            - <Theme 2>

            **Overall Sentiment:** <Positive/Neutral/Negative>

Thanks everyone for joining. First off, John gave an update on the Q3 marketing campaignâ€”it's 70% complete but running behind due to resource constraints. Lisa mentioned the design team is waiting on final copy before they can proceed.
Tom raised a concern about overlapping responsibilities with the sales team and suggested a joint sync next week. We agreed to have a draft timeline ready by Friday. Emily will follow up on the email comms plan and share it by Thursday.
Meeting ended with a quick look at next week's priorities, focusing on conversion tracking and onboarding improvements.
