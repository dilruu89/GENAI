Thanks everyone for joining. First off, John gave an update on the Q3 marketing campaignâ€”it's 70% complete but running behind due to resource constraints. Lisa mentioned the design team is waiting on final copy before they can proceed.

Tom raised a concern about overlapping responsibilities with the sales team and suggested a joint sync next week. We agreed to have a draft timeline ready by Friday. Emily will follow up on the email comms plan and share it by Thursday.

Meeting ended with a quick look at next week's priorities, focusing on conversion tracking and onboarding improvements.
